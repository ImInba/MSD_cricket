# MSD_cricket
A simple cricket game which works based on random number generation in java.

->Enter the team names and overs and it will automatically play the game and show the results


->Entering an invalid team name would result in random picking of a team rather than a crash :P


->Tossing works the same way as in real cricket game. Captain of a team tosses the coin and opponent team's captain makes a call. Based on the flipping result, the toss winning captain will decide whether to bat or field first

-> Happy cricketing
